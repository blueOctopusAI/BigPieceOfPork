and global economies, including manufacturing sectors. Semiconductors are also essential to the national security of the United States.
(2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought
about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other complex factors impacting the overall supply chain, has
threatened the economic recovery of the United
States and industries that employ millions of United
States citizens.
(3) Addressing current challenges and building
resilience against future risks requires ensuring a secure and stable supply chain for semiconductors that
will support the economic and national security
needs of the United States and its allies.
(4) The supply chain for semiconductors is
complex and global. While the United States plays
a leading role in certain segments of the semiconductor industry, securing the supply chain requires
onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable segments, such as for—
(A) fabrication;
(B) advanced packaging; and
(C) materials and equipment used to manufacture semiconductor products.
(5) The Federal Government can leverage foreign direct investment and private dollars to grow
the domestic manufacturing and production capacity
of the United States for vulnerable segments of the
semiconductor supply chain.
(6) The SelectUSA program of the Department
of Commerce, in coordination with other Federal
agencies and State-level economic development organizations, is positioned to boost foreign direct investment in domestic manufacturing and to help secure
the semiconductor supply chain of the United States.

DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS.
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA
shall solicit comments from State-level economic development organizations—
(1) to review—
(A) what efforts the Federal Government
can take to support increased foreign direct investment in any segment of semiconductor-related production;

exist and how to amplify State efforts to attract
such investment;
(C) public opportunities those organizations have identified to attract foreign direct investment to help increase investment described
in subparagraph (A); and
(D) resource gaps or other challenges that
prevent those organizations from increasing
such investment; and
(2) to develop recommendations for—
(A) how SelectUSA can increase such investment independently or through partnership
with those organizations; and
(B) working with countries that are allies
or partners of the United States to ensure that
foreign adversaries (as defined in section
8(c)(2) of the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C.
1607(c)(2))) do not benefit from United States
efforts to increase such investment.
SEC. 1405. REPORT ON INCREASING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN SEMICONDUCTOR-RELATED
MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION.
Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA,
in coordination with the Federal Interagency Investment
Working Group established by Executive Order 13577 (76
Fed. Reg. 35,715; relating to establishment of the
SelectUSA Initiative), shall submit to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House
of Representatives a report that includes—
(1) a review of the comments SelectUSA received from State-level economic development organizations under section 4;

semiconductor-related manufacturing and production; and

strategies or recommendations SelectUSA received from those organizations.
